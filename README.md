# What Time Is It? – Environment & Level Design Portfolio [file:1]

This repository showcases my environment and level design work for the narrative puzzle game **“What Time Is It?”**, a time-travel experience focused on environmental sustainability and player-driven consequences. [file:1]

---

## Project Overview

- **Genre:** Narrative puzzle / exploration [file:1]  
- **Setting:** A single family home and garden shifting across Past, Present, and Future timelines [file:1]  
- **Core Themes:** Time travel, environmental impact, sustainability, everyday domestic life [file:1]  
- **My Role:** Environment & level designer, co-developer of interactive systems linked to time travel and environmental changes [file:1]  

The player navigates the same house and garden in different timelines, solving puzzles that alter the environment and reveal the consequences of human actions over time. [file:1]

## Systems & Analysis Images

### Environmental Change Across Timelines

- `![Environmental Changes Across Timelines](Docs/Images/environment_timeline_chart.png)` – **Fig 15. Environmental Changes Across Timelines**, visualising Past, Present and Future states. [file:1]  

This chart illustrates: [file:1]  
- Past: Lush, green, tree-filled world.  
- Present: Reduced greenery and more urbanisation.  
- Future: Barren landscape with no trees, emphasising long-term consequences.

### Player Engagement Metrics

- `![Player Engagement Metrics](Docs/Images/player_engagement_metrics.png)` – **Fig 16. Player Engagement Metrics**, summarising feedback on puzzle complexity, visual clarity and narrative depth. [file:1]  

Findings show: [file:1]  
- Strong enjoyment of puzzle complexity.  
- Positive reception of the low-poly, pastel art style.  
- High engagement with the time travel narrative and branching environmental outcomes.

## My Contribution

I focused on **environment design**, **level layout**, and **co-developing systems** that connect time travel, puzzles, and environmental storytelling. [file:1]

- Designed the **family home** and **garden** to feel lived-in, emotionally grounded, and mechanically functional. [file:1]  
- Built **room layouts** that support exploration, puzzle-solving, and narrative beats. [file:1]  
- Co-developed systems where **actions in one timeline affect another** (for example, planting in the Past changing the Future garden state). [file:1]  
- Collaborated on **player research**, analysing feedback and adjusting navigation, lighting, and object clarity. [file:1]  

---

## Design Goals

- **Thematic consistency** – Relatable home that integrates time travel and environmental storytelling. [file:1]  
- **Timeline transformation** – Clear visual differences between Past (lush), Present (strained), and Future (barren) environments. [file:1]  
- **Visual clarity & navigation** – Bold shapes, clean compositions, and guided lighting for easy recognition of interactables and paths. [file:1]  
- **Optimised low-poly style** – Low-poly, pastel aesthetic for charm, performance and strong silhouettes, especially for browser play. [file:1]
